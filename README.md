 --output-document ~/bin/hours
chmod +x ~/bin/hours
```

## Usage

```
Usage: hours <command> (arguments...)"

Commands:"
  today - displays hours logged today"
  day (((y-)m-)d) - displays hours logged in a day (default=today)"
  month (m) (y) - displays hours logged in a month (default=this month)"
  log <action> (datetime) - logs an action"

Actions:"
  IN - start logging work"
  OUT - stop logging work"
```

## Configuration

Worklog looks for a config file located in `~/.worklog`.
It should be a valid shell script (its loaded by `hours` script with `source` comand).

The configuration script must define following variables:

```sh
DATA_DIR=/path/to/worklog/data/
```

In case `~/.worklog` does not exist, the script creates it with following
default configuration.

```
DATA_DIR=$HOME/worklog
```
